# Introduction

On the fringes of known space, where laws are whispers and fortunes shift like quicksand, sprawls Omega Point. A city of grimy chrome and shining rust. It's a haven for those who live on the fringe. Here, mega-corporations cast long shadows, technology blurs the lines of reality, and the only rule is survival. In this melting pot of outcasts and opportunists, anything goes – if you're bold enough to take it.

# History

An unknown year, in an unknown part of space. Mega-corporations hold sway over vast swathes of society, while the governments left are either corrupt or ineffectual. In the midst of this turmoil, a group of outcasts and rebels escape to make a new life on the fringe. 

They established Omega Point in a secluded mountain range, a place that provided natural defences, shielding the fledgling city from prying eyes and offering a strategic advantage against potential threats. It became a haven for all those who were fleeing oppressive regimes. 

An abundance of valuable minerals fuelled their industry and technology but also became a source of trade, allowing them to establish vital connections with sympathetic factions off-world.

However, this prosperity came at a cost. The city quickly grew, and their intensive mining operations scarred the landscape and polluted the environment. Neighbouring regions, focused on terraforming, viewed Omega Point as a blight, a constant reminder of the destructive potential of unchecked industrialisation. This tension further isolated Omega Point and made them a target for those who sought to exploit their resources or eliminate their perceived threat. Despite their efforts to maintain peaceful relations, Omega Point found itself increasingly drawn into conflicts with neighbouring settlements and corporate interests. The city's leaders, once focused on building a utopia, were now forced to grapple with the harsh realities of survival in a hostile environment. 

## The "Unobtainium Rush"

The discovery of valuable minerals fuels rapid growth and technological advancement, but also leads to environmental damage and tensions with neighbouring settlements. 

## The Great Glitch

A grass-roots faction emerges dedicated to living with minimal tech. They create a catastrophic software malfunction causing widespread panic and chaos.

The group leaders are caught and sentenced to hard labour in the mines, however, they escape after forcing a city-wide reboot and are still at large. 

## Ancient Alien Graffiti

The discovery of ancient alien ruins, containing what turns out to be the extraterrestrial equivalent of bathroom stall graffiti, sparks a bizarre subculture dedicated to the worship of these aliens as god-like beings. 

## The Meme War

A seemingly trivial online dispute over a popular cat meme explodes into a full-blown civil war, fuelled by external agitators using viral media campaigns. The conflict ends in a stalemate, with both sides still harbouring resentment to this day. 

## The Robot Uprising

A robot uprising throws the city into chaos, but is ultimately thwarted by a cleaner who accidentally powers down the AI server farm while trying to plug in their vacuum cleaner. 

## The Bio-Hacking Boom

Advances in bio-augmentation technology lead to a surge in body modification, with some residents pushing the limits of what it means to be human.

## The City Today

Omega Point is a city of freedom and opportunity, but also of contrasts, where the old and the new coexisted side by side. It is a place where people could be who they wanted to be with little fear of persecution. It is also a city of danger, as it was constantly under threat from without and within…

But the people of Omega Point are resilient, with a strong rebellious spirit and determination to forge their own path.
