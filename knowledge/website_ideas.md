Tunnel Pursuit Lore
Origins:
"Tunnel Pursuit" began as an underground motorsport, attracting daredevils and adrenaline junkies who sought the thrill of high-speed races through abandoned mineshafts. The sport's origins can be traced back to a group of miners who, after their shifts, would modify old mining equipment into makeshift racing vehicles. Over time, this underground activity gained popularity and eventually evolved into a more organized event.
The Tunnel Pursuit League:
The "Tunnel Pursuit League" was formed to bring structure and regulation to the sport. Despite its official sanctioning by the city, it retains an edgy and dangerous appeal, drawing both participants and spectators who are drawn to the raw excitement of the races. The League organizes regular events, complete with sponsorships from various corporations eager to capitalize on the sport's growing popularity
