# Areas and Districts

The city is similar to an inverted diamond shape, split vertically in to 3 regions: Topside, Center and Underside, each containing their own districts. 

## Topside

Topside is the upper area of the city, containing bustling docks and sprawling slums. Heavily polluted due to years of industrial refining. Prone to highly-shifting weather pattern ranging from constant acid rain to dangerous radiation storms.

### Pinnacle

A luxury resort for the mega-rich. Housed atop a skyscraper, ascending high above the clouds of pollution. Renowned for it's decadence and excess. The base of the tower is heavily defended against possible intrusion from the common people.

### Newport

Newport is the beating heart of Omega Point's trade scene. Here, massive hover-ships delivering goods and minerals from around the globe dock daily. But beyond the legitimate exports and imports, the port harbours a shady underbelly of smuggling and black market dealings. 

Nestled on the cliffs overlooking the city, Newport is the domain of the wealthy elite. Dazzling skyscrapers with sleek chrome exteriors and holographic billboards house the famous faces of Omega Point. Movie stars, CEOs, and influential politicians call this enclave home, living in ostentatious luxury.

The district features extravagant mansions with lavish gardens, private luxury pools, and state-of-the-art security systems. Newport is self-contained, with gourmet restaurants, exclusive clubs, and designer boutiques catering to the whims of the ultra-rich. However, the region also has its share of scandals and dark secrets, ripe for exploration. 

### Cliffside

Perched precariously on the edges of the mountain range, the Cliffside slums are where the underprivileged masses of Omega Point reside. Cramped, makeshift dwellings cling to the sides of steep cliffs, with rickety walkways and suspension bridges connecting different parts of the slum. 

Despite the squalor, the Cliffside Slums have a vibrant underworld culture of their own. Freelance mechanics, hackers, and petty criminals ply their trades here, often using their unique skills to exploit the corporate interests that dominate the rest of the city. The slums are the perfect setting for stories of rebellion, ingenuity, and survival against the odds. The Cliffside Slums are a hotbed of criminal activity, with gangs vying for control of the lucrative smuggling and black market trades that thrive in the shadows of Omega Point. The most notorious of these gangs is the Red Syndicate, led by the ruthless crime lord known only as "

### Heap

A dense industrial zone constructed on and around a massive heap of industrial refuse. The Heap is populated with resourceful scavengers, metal workers, and recyclers known as heapers. A small shanty town known as The landscape is a nightmarish maze of tangled pipes, wires, and scorched metal. Local artisans create jewellery and sculptures from salvaged parts. Street markets are the best places to find rare components or hard-to-find circuitry. It is

### Precipice

Precipice is a thrill-seeker's paradise, a vertigo-inducing district perched on the precipice of Omega Point's skyline, where adrenaline junkies engage in death-defying feats like BASE jumping and illegal street luge races. Its soaring spires and precarious walkways push the boundaries of gravity and architectural possibility, while the district's subversive underworld features secret casinos, speakeasies, and VR dens peddling cutting-edge technologies and forbidden pleasures. Reinforced with ultra-durable materials and sporting mandatory safety systems, Precipice attracts those who dare to tempt fate, embodying the city's rebellious spirit of unbridled innovation and survival against impossible odds. It is 

### Greenhouse

A massive hydroponic agriculture complex nestled within the more temperate part of the mountains. Dominated by towering greenhouses and vertical farms, this region is home to bio-engineers, farmers, and plant whisperers. The air here is cleaner, and the streets are lined with market stalls selling exotic fruits and genetically modified plants.

Crossing boundary between Topside and Center, Greenhouse is primarily vertical, with The Dome at the top, and many levels directly below. 

#### The Dome

The Dome is a massive, transparent structure that covers the entire Greenhouse district. It allows sunlight to reach the crops and provides a controlled environment for optimal growth. The Dome is maintained by a team of skilled engineers and technicians who ensure its integrity and functionality.

## Center

The site of the original mining district, center is a collection of  now converted into a huge chasm and sprawling network of tunnels and chambers. Site of the oldest buildings and political centre of the city. 

### Foundry
Engineering hub. Responsible for creating and maintaining the various machines and technology used throughout Omega Point.

## Underside

### Mines

Residents here are expert miners and tunnelers, known for their resilience and tenacity. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and the hum of machinery. Neon signs advertise illegal mining equipment and "unstable" energy drinks. 

### Thermal Core

The city's primary power generation hub. The Thermal Core is a massive, underground facility that generates power for the entire city. It harnesses the heat from the planet's core to produce energy, which is then distributed through a network of power lines to every district. The facility is staffed by a team of highly trained engineers and technicians who monitor the systems and ensure the smooth operation of the Thermal Core.
